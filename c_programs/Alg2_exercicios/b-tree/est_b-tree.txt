Tree is a linked data structure in which each node is an object.
Each node contains:
    o Left
    o right
    o p (nodes corresponding to its left child, its right child, and its parent, respectively).

If a child or the parent is missing, the appropriate attribute contains the value NULL. The root node is the only node in the tree whose parent is NULL.

Binary-search-tree property:
    Let x be a node in a binary search tree. If y is a node in the left subtree of x, then y.key <= x.key. if y is a node in the right subtree of x, then y.key >= x.key.

The BST - P allows us to print out all the keys in a binary seach tree in sorted order by a simple recursive algorithm:
